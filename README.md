Cal-C.Ai
Advanced Calculator and Verification Platform — a Python-powered service designed to provide intelligent calculator capabilities, verification workflows, and database-backed management, packaged with containerization support and migration tools for production-ready deployment.
________________


Project Overview:
Cal-C.Ai is more than just a calculator — it is a full-featured verification and computation platform built with Python. Unlike traditional calculators, Cal-C.Ai integrates a database engine, migration support using Alembic, and optional containerization via Docker. The platform is designed for accuracy, scalability, and maintainability, making it suitable for developers, students, and businesses needing precise calculation and verification services.

Key Features:
* Advanced Calculation Engine: Handles complex arithmetic, formulas, and potentially custom user-defined operations.
* Verification Workflows: Supports validation of calculations, inputs, or data entries for reliability and correctness.
* Database Integration: Uses SQLAlchemy models and Alembic migrations for persistent storage and versioned schema management.
* Containerization: Dockerfile provided for building portable application containers. Optional Docker Compose setup for running with PostgreSQL locally.
* Modular Architecture: Clear separation into core/, data_integration/, and alembic/ folders for maintainable, scalable code.
* Developer Friendly: Makefile and .env.example simplify setup, migration, and running tasks.

Use Cases & Real-World Problem Solving:
1. Education: Students can perform advanced calculations, validate steps, and learn from verified outputs.
2. Small Business Accounting: Businesses can use Cal-C.Ai to ensure correct financial computations, including tax calculations, discounts, or complex billing.
3. Data Verification: Cal-C.Ai can be integrated into larger systems to verify incoming data or calculations for accuracy before storing in production databases.
4. Scientific Computing: Researchers can use Cal-C.Ai for formula-based computations that require verified precision and traceability.
5. Automation: Developers can build automated scripts leveraging Cal-C.Ai’s API endpoints for repeated calculations and verification tasks, reducing human errors.
Problems it solves:
* Eliminates manual calculation errors.
* Provides persistent history of calculations with database storage.
* Enables reproducible verification workflows for professional and educational use.
* Simplifies setup and deployment with Docker and Makefile automation.

Setup Instructions:
1. Clone the repository

cd ~/Documents/GitHub
git clone https://github.com/ROSHANDAPPU/Cal-C.Ai.git
cd Cal-C.Ai


2. Create a virtual environment & install dependencies

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate          # macOS / Linux
# .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1       # Windows PowerShell
# .venv\Scripts\activate           # Windows cmd
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Then edit .env to provide any secrets or DB URL if needed
nano .env


4. Apply database migrations
alembic upgrade head


5. Run the app
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000


Open your browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000 to check the app, or /docs if using FastAPI.
________________


Optional: Run with Docker
docker build -t cal-cai:latest .
docker run --rm --env-file .env -p 8000:8000 cal-cai:latest


Or using docker-compose.yml (if PostgreSQL is needed):
docker-compose up --build


________________


Alembic Commands (for DB migrations):
# Create new migration
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "describe change"


# Apply all migrations
alembic upgrade head


# Rollback last migration
alembic downgrade -1


________________


Makefile Shortcuts:


make init         # Setup virtualenv & install dependencies
make migrate      # Run alembic migrations
make run          # Start the app locally
make docker-build # Build Docker image
make docker-run   # Run Docker container

Best Practices & Contribution:
* Always use .env for secrets; .env.example stays in repo.
* Avoid committing __pycache__ and temporary files (added to .gitignore).
* Open an issue before major changes.

* Submit pull requests with clear descriptions of your changes
